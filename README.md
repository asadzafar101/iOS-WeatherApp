# iOS-WeatherApp
iOS Weather App - a minimal mobile application that offers real-time weather updates and forecasts at your fingertips. Our goal is to provide customers with an easy-to-use, dependable, and accurate weather software that can help them plan their daily activities and keep them informed of changing weather conditions.
The app was created with SwiftUI language on Xcode. SwiftUI is a user
interface toolkit that was introduced by Apple in 2019. It is designed to make it
easier and faster for developers to create user interfaces for iOS, macOS,
watchOS, and tvOS apps. SwiftUI uses a declarative syntax, which means that
developers define what their app's user interface should look like, and the
framework automatically generates the code needed to create that interface. This
approach is more efficient than traditional imperative programming, which
requires developers to write detailed instructions for every element of the user
interface. Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) created by
Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms. It
includes a suite of software development tools, such as a code editor, compiler,
and debugger, as well as various interface builder tools and utilities for testing
and profiling code.
I divided the app into four different parts and name them as views one is
content view which is responsible to display all the content the second one is
welcome view which is responsible for all the welcome page data the third one is
loading view which is responsible to show a loading symbol and the fourth and
the last one is weather view which is responsible to show the main page and all
the frame work of the main page.

Content View: 
Using SwiftUI, this code implements the main screen of an iOS weather
app. The ContentView is in charge of keeping track of the app's state and showing
the necessary views based on that state. It provides a LocationManager instance
for determining the user's position and a WeatherManager instance for retrieving
weather data.
The body of the ContentView is a VStack that displays several views based
on the app's current state. If the app successfully obtains the user's location, it
attempts to retrieve weather data from the weatherManager. The program
displays the WeatherView if the weather data has already been retrieved.
Otherwise, a LoadingView is displayed while the app asynchronously retrieves
weather data. If the program has not yet gotten the user's location, it displays the
WelcomeView with a button to request the user's location. A LoadingView is
displayed instead if the location manager is presently loading the user's location.
Finally, the ContentView determines the app's backdrop color and color scheme.
A preview provider is also included with the ContentView, which generates a
preview of the view in Xcode's canvas.

Welcome View: 
The offered code implements the welcome screen for an iOS weather app. A
headline, a weather emoji, a button to share the current location, and links to the
app's terms and conditions, the about page, and the OpenWeather website are all
included on the screen. The view is specified as a SwiftUI struct that follows the
View protocol. The view's UI is returned by the body property. SwiftUI views and
modifiers are used to define the UI.
The first VStack includes the app title as well as the weather emoji. To
provide some vertical separation, these are arranged inside a VStack with a
spacing of 20. To center the text, use the multilineTextAlignment modifier.
The LocationButton is the next view supplied by the CoreLocationUI framework.
This button allows the user to notify the app of their current position. When the
button is pressed, the LocationManager object, which is a @EnvironmentObject
property of the view, calls the requestLocation method. The parent view injects
this property into the view hierarchy.
Following the LocationButton is another VStack with links to the app's
terms and conditions, about page, and the OpenWeather website. The Link view,
which accepts a destination URL and a label as inputs, is used to define each link.
The Label view, which accepts a title and an icon as parameters, is used to define
the label. The Text view is used to define the title and the icon is defined with the
systemName argument in the Image view.
To provide horizontal separation, each Link is then wrapped in an HStack.
The VStack containing the links is then wrapped in another VStack with padding
and a clipShape modification to give it the appearance of a rounded capsule.
Finally, the complete UI is wrapped in another VStack with an infinity maxWidth
and maxHeight to maximize the view's area. The WelcomeView_Previews struct is
a SwiftUI preview provider that displays a preview of the view in the Xcode
canvas. The previews property returns a WelcomeView instance, which is used to
construct the preview.

Loading View: 
The offered code implements a loading screen for an iOS weather app. A circular
progress indicator is centered in the view on the screen.
The view is specified as a SwiftUI struct that follows the View protocol. The view's
UI is returned by the body property. The ProgressView and
CircularProgressViewStyle views and modifiers are used to define the UI.
The ProgressView is a SwiftUI view that displays a progress bar. A progress view
style that displays a circular progress indicator is the CircularProgressViewStyle.
The tint parameter is used to customize the color of the progress bar.
The circular style is then applied to the ProgressView using the progressViewStyle
modifier. The circular style is then applied to the ProgressView using the
progressViewStyle modifier. The ProgressView is then given the frame modifier,
which causes it to take up the entire available area in the view. To allow the view
to grow as much as possible, the maxWidth and maxHeight parameters are set to
infinite. The LoadingView_Previews struct is a SwiftUI preview provider that
displays a preview of the view in the Xcode canvas. The previews property returns
a LoadingView object that is used to generate the preview.

Weather View:
This code creates a SwiftUI view called WeatherView, which displays weather
data for a given location. The view accepts a weather argument of type
ResponseBody, which is a struct containing weather information like as
temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
The WeatherView is made up of a ZStack and two VStacks. The first VStack
comprises data such as the name of the city, the date and time, a weather icon,
and the temperature. The second VStack shows additional weather data such as
minimum and maximum temperatures, wind speed, and humidity.
The view additionally includes an AsyncImage that displays a city image. If
the image has not yet been loaded, a ProgressView is shown instead.
The WeatherView makes use of SwiftUI modifiers such as frame, padding,
foregroundColor, and backgroundColor to change the appearance of the view,
use the background property. The view also disregards the safe area at the
bottom of the screen and defaults to dark.
